# Spiral or helix project

The main results of the calculation can be seen in the [Python Notebook](Joint_face_normal_method.ipynb).

The theory is mostly adapted from [https://github.com/PubInv/segmented-helixes/](https://github.com/PubInv/segmented-helixes/), but adapted to our case.

For things to do, look at the issues on the [github page](https://github.com/jocelas/spiral) of this project.
